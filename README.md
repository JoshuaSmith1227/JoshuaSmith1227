# Hi, I'm Joshua Smith 👋

I'm a third-year Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) student at **Carnegie Mellon University**.

My passion lies at the intersection of **low-level systems engineering**, **production-scale AI**, and **creative development**. I build high-performance, fault-tolerant systems, whether it's optimizing a corporate AI pipeline, designing a 3D environment for millions of users, or writing a memory allocator in C.

Below are my three main portfolios, which I've pinned to my profile.

---

### 1. 💼 Corporate AI & Performance Engineering
* **Repository:** [**Salliemae-Software-Engineering-Intern**](./Salliemae-Software-Engineering-Intern)
* **What it is:** A technical deep-dive into my 2025 internship. I owned the performance optimization of a production AI classification tool, reducing its runtime from **200+ hours to ~1 hour** (a 200x improvement) by implementing concurrent batch processing.

### 2. 🎨 Creative & 3D/GameDev Portfolio
* **Repository:** [**FiveWalnut-Creative-Portfolio**](./FiveWalnut-Creative-Portfolio)
* **What it is:** My professional portfolio as a 3D artist and game developer ("FiveWalnut"). This work includes **official collaborations with Epic Games**, features in *Newsweek* and *Business of Esports*, and projects that have reached over **20 million players**.

### 3. 📚 Academic Core Systems Portfolio
* **Repository:** [**CMU-Project-Portfolio**](./CMU-Project-Portfolio)
* **What it is:** High-level summaries of my most complex academic projects, including a **Dynamic Memory Allocator**, a **Lightweight C JVM Interpreter**, and a **Python 3D Modeling Engine**. (The code is kept private to maintain academic integrity, but I am happy to provide a 1-on-1 walkthrough).
